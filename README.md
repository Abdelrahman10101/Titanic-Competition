# Titanic-Competition
Kaggle Titanic Survival Prediction Project
Developed a machine learning model to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using Python and libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.
Performed extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and relationships in the dataset.
Choosing usful features to enhance model performance.
Implemented and compared classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
Gained practical experience in handling missing data, scaling features, and evaluating models with performance metrics like accuracy.
